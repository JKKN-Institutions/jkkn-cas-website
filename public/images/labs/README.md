## Image Optimization

- Use JPG format for photographs
- Optimize file size for web (aim for < 200KB per image)
- Maintain 4:3 aspect ratio for consistent display
- Ensure images are high quality but web-optimized

## Usage

These images are displayed in a responsive 3-column grid on the Labs page:
- Desktop/Tablet: 3 images side by side
- Mobile: 3 images stacked vertically

The images use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization and lazy loading.
